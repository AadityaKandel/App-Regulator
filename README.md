# App-Regulator
This is the new app regulator for blocking any executables you want. Run it once, choose executables, choose type of block and you can do it easily. I'll be adding some GOOD features soon


I'll try my best to add the following features under my knowledge
> Camouflage [Hides the window while asking for admin and launches another app like Notepad to avoid suspicion]

> Profiles [Save, Save As, Load]


---------------------------------------------------------------------
# UPDATE V2

> I've added both Camouflage & Profiles Feature to my app on the same day. It was hella hard & I might've made like 30 executables to come this far

> However, only "Profiles" feature works on this script because an executable is required for the "Camouflage" technique to work

> Hence, if you want the full experience, go for the Executable Version: https://github.com/AadityaKandel/App-Regulator-Executable

> However, you can see the code which I designed for the executable version which I've commented on this script.

# UPDATE V3

> I've solved some issues and added an extra feature

> Now, the profile you save will be encrypted everytime, leading to more security

> If the file is modified in some way, it won't be accepted

# UPDATE V4

> I've solved some further issues and added an additional feature called "Scan Apps"

> While you already had features to select apps, it wasn't as convenient as this feature

> It automatically scans all the apps within your system for you and lets you select them as your target

> ENJOY & THANK YOU!!
