# App-Regulator
This is the new app regulator for blocking any executables you want. Run it once, choose executables, choose type of block and you can do it easily. I'll be adding some GOOD features soon


I'll try my best to add the following features under my knowledge
> Camouflage [Hides the window while asking for admin and launches another app like Notepad to avoid suspicion]

> Profiles [Save, Save As, Load]


---------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE

> I've added both Camouflage & Profiles Feature to my app on the same day. It was hella hard & I might've made like 30 executables to come this far

> However, only "Profiles" feature works on this script because an executable is required for the "Camouflage" technique to work

> Hence, if you want the full experience, go for the Executable Version

> However, you can see the code which I designed for the executable version, I've commented it on this script.

> Thank You. Any issues later on will be fixed once discovered.
