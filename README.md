# App-Regulator
This is the new app regulator for blocking any executables you want. Run it once, choose executables, choose type of block and you can do it easily. I'll be adding some GOOD features soon


I'll try my best to add the following features under my knowledge
> Camouflage [Hides the window while asking for admin and launches another app like Notepad to avoid suspicion]

> Profiles [Save, Save As, Load]
